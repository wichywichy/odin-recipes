        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons oil (any neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola)</li>
                <li>3 thin slices ginger</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic (thinly sliced)</li>
                <li>2 links Chinese sausage</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion</li>
                <li>8 ounces snow peas</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>1/4 tablespoon white pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the ginger slices for 20 seconds. Add the garlic and Chinese sausage. Increase the heat to medium, and cook for a minute or two until the fat in the sausage turns translucent.</li>    
                <li>Add the onions and snow peas. Mix everything well. Add the Shaoxing wine, white pepper, sesame oil, and salt. Stir-fry everything for 1-2 more minutes. If the stir fry is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of water.</li>
                <li>Now, to the filling. Chop the meat according to our article on how to hand-chop your own ground meat, until the beef resembles sausage meat in texture. This may take up to 30 minutes, so be patient! If using ground beef, skip this step.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the minced garlic, light soy sauce, oyster sauce and 3 tablespoons of water. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Set aside.</li>
                <li>The dish is done once the snow peas are bright green and the onions are cooked, but still have a little bit of crunch.</li>
            </ol>
